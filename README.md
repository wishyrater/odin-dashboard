# odin-dashboard

In this project I wil create a dashboard, going by this design concept: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png.

The purpose of this project is to practice the usage of grid layouts. I will be creating grids to space out and lay out the content elements, and subgrids to further structure the conteint inside the page.

This project displays key skills within advanced HTML and CSS.
